# data_dive

Workshop material from Smart Cville Drug Crime Data Deep Dirve event on 2018-02-07.

If you dont like messing with package installs and do like Docker. [Jeff Xing's got you, with a ready to roll RStudio server image](https://github.com/jfx319/datadive2018-02-07), plus nice instructions to boot!

Contains:

* An Rmd with my ioslides.

* A walkthough code script with all of the slide code and them some to fully reproduce all the figures in the deck. So you can run lines/chunks yourself and see the magic happen.

* A fill-along code script with empty slots for more advanced users to type along and try to guess the right function calls. DataCamp style but without the helpful error messages or hints.
