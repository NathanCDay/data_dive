# data_dive

Workshop material from Smart Cville Drug Crime Data Deep Dirve event on 2018-02-07.

Contains:

An Rmd with my slide in ioslide format.

A walkthough code script with all of the slide code and them some to fully reproduce all the figures in the deck. So you can run lines/chunks yourself and see the magic happen.

A fill-along code script with empty slots for more advanced users to type along and try to guess the write calls. DataCamp style but without the helpful error messages or hints.
